### 2. [Localization: Kidnapped Vehicle](https://github.com/shengchen-liu/CarND-Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project-master) 

Implement a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++.  The particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step the filter will also get observation and control data.
